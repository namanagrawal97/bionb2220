tmp83,"I think AI is computer learning system which utilizes learning and memory to adapt to the environment, as well as having the advantage of access to the entire web. It is similar to my definition of intelligence in that revolves around problem solving, however I believe humans have further aspects to consider such as emotions and morals, which cannot be quantified by AI.",medium,low,low,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Somewhat agree
