nyz4,"My definition of AI is that it is a machine with human-level reasoning capabilities, so it is the same as my definition of intelligence. The mechanism behind strong AI and human intelligence might be different, but the function is the same, in my opinion.

jb2333,"AI is the ability of a machine to perform tasks based on human intelligence. It is the same as my definition of intelligence, because AI can only use human intelligence.Â AI has no feelings, emotions, or morals.

nac88,"I think that AI is an algorithmic way for computers to process information and change their algorithms based on feedback from a human trainer. I don't necessarily think that this is the exact same as my definition of intelligence in the way that a person is intelligent, because the computer lacks consciousness and emotion in its decision making. AI may be more akin to learning/intelligence of other, simpler animals.",medium,medium,medium,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Somewhat agree

tmp83,"AI is a digitized neural network which learns from its environment via algorithms and various inputs. It has the ability learn and improve a task function from its previous attempts. It is similar to my definition of intelligence in that it has the ability to problem solve given its own tools and resources available to it, however it does not fully encompass all the aspects of human intelligence which includes autonomy.",high,medium,high,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree
